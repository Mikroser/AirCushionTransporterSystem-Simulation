# AirCushionTransporterSystem-Simulation

This is a simulation of Air Cushion Transporter System. It should has lines of metal and feet of the machine as circles. Moreover, all the circles will move in a single circular motion until they align with the lines that means the machine is locked in place through these number of feet/circles.

To-Do:
- [x] Add the lines.
- [ ] Add the circles.
- [ ] Make the circles move in circular motion.
- [ ] Calculate how many circles aligned with the lines.
- [ ] Add Start and Stop buttons to stop the movement  of the circles.
